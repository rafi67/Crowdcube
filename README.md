Crowdcube is a prominent crowdfunding platform that enables businesses, particularly startups, to raise capital by offering equity to investors. It operates as an equity crowdfunding platform, meaning investors receive a stake in the company in exchange for their contributions. Unlike donation-based crowdfunding, which funds personal needs or creative projects without offering financial returns, Crowdcube focuses on businesses seeking to scale or develop.

This model appeals to entrepreneurs who want to secure funding while also building a community of supporters who have a vested interest in their success. Investors, in turn, gain an opportunity to support businesses they believe in and potentially earn a return on their investment if the business grows.
